## Quick Start

### Installation

Be sure you have Node.js and NPM installed.  
Clone the repository and move to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dvilla8/ig-planner.git && cd ig-planner
```

Install dependencies and run the project with `yarn` or `npm`:

```bash
npm install && npm run dev

# or use yarn
yarn install && yarn dev
```

### Configuration

Instagram Planner isn't a drag & drop tool since I prefer to edit a configuration file with my favorite code editor.  
If you know how to properly edit a JSON file using a text editor or a code editor, it will be really simple.

Read more about configuration in [Getting Started](getting-started#configuration).
