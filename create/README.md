### Configuration

You can update your profile by editing `src/public/user/instagram/{username}`.  
Update `planner.config.ts` accordingly. Read the [documentation](https://dxlliv.github.io/planner/docs/) for further information.

### Interactive Planning

You might like to plan your profile directly using a simple user interface.  
In that case, just upload the media and rearrange your grid as desired.

Then export your changes as a zip file and overwrite the existing profile.
