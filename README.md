## Documentation

## Getting started

Be sure you have Node.js and NPM installed.  
Clone the repository and move to the project directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dxlliv/ig-planner.git && cd ig-planner
```

Install dependencies and run the project with `yarn` or `npm`:
``` bash
npm install && npm run dev

# or use yarn
yarn install && yarn dev
```

### Configuration

Instagram Planner isn't a drag & drop tool since I prefer to edit a configuration file with my favorite code editor.    
If you know how to properly edit a JSON file using a text editor or a code editor, it will be really simple.

Read the [documentation](https://dxlliv.github.io/ig-planner/docs) for further info.
